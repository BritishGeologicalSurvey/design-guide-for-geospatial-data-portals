# Introduction

## Purpose

The goal of these guidelines is to help BGS application developers create web APIs that are:

* **Fit for purpose** -  by good design and understanding of user needs, and architecture that provides non-functional requirements
* **Sufficiently documented** - by using OpenAPI 
* **Consistent and predictable in behaviour**  - by re-using patterns for architecture, query parameters, response data schemas, versioning
* **Quick and easy to implement** - by providing the boiler plate code and libraries that handle the architecture and repeatable stuff so you only have to code the parts that are particular to you

## Resources

- Get off to a running start with a Reference Implementation in [Java](reference-implementations/java.md), [Node](reference-implementations/node.md) or [Python](reference-implementations/python.md)
- [JSON Schema Library](appendices/json-schema-library.md) A cut-and-paste library of Schemas for commonly used parameters and properties. Use these to quickly generate consistent OpenAPI specifications.
