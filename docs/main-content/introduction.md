# Spatial data portals

Increase the discoverability and usefulness of spatial data by designing data portals that satisfy user needs. 

Data portals differ by the data they provide and the audiences they serve, so these recommendations are general and focus on designs to address the frustrations that users experience at different stages of their data discovery journey.

## Everything happens somewhere
Location is a fundamental aspect of many data and being able to combine and integrate seemingly diverse datasets using locality can provide powerful insights. 

Although more and more spatial data is being made available online, there there are users who are confused about where to go, who to trust and which datsets are most relevant to answering their questions.       

In 2018 user researchers and designers across the <u>Geo6</u> came together to explore the needs and frustrations experienced by the users of data portals containing spatial data.

Throughout 2019 the Geo6 have worked on solutions to address the pain points identified in the <u>DD2 report</u>.

## User journey
Users discover, access and interact with data portals in a range of ways depending on what they are trying to achive, who they are and whether they are a first time vistor or a regular user. We have identifed five broad stages of most user journeys. Below is the archetypical journey people might go through in their search for data. It doesn’t mean that every user will go through the same stages, but they represent the steps the majority of people would have to complete in order to find, get access and make use of spatial data.

## Common painpoints for users
User research conducted on behalf of the Geospatial Commision identifed many issues that led to users being confused and frustrated. Poor usability and functionality reduces trust and impact of potentially valuable data. 

Our recommendations are designed to address the following painpoints:  
1. Discover data sources
* Lack of domain knowledge when searching
* Uncertainty about which keywords to use in search engine
* Reliance on personal recommendations rather than search engine results
* Unclear signage //NEED TO CLARIFY
* Difficulty understanding where data originates from
* No one portal contains all the required data
2. Search within data portal
* Not knowing the best terminology to use
* User interface allows limited search functionality
* Inadequate filtering options - reset issues //NEED TO CLARIFY 
* Require more temporal and flexible search parameters
* Usability documentation is unhelpful
3. Understand search results
* Overwhelming amount of results / data returned
* Multiple results contain the same data
* Poor or invalid descriptions
* Misinformation within data sets 
* Acronyms are difficult to interpret and understand
* Off the shelf search / sort and filter algorithms are often inadequate //NEED TO CLARIFY
* Ranking by “best match” did not match user expectations //NEED TO CLARIFY
* Frequency of search term per record is a bad descriptor of rank //NEED TO CLARIFY
4. Explore data records
* No online preview of data
* Data formats are not clearly defined or structured
* Metadata titles are not written in plain English
* It is not clear what 'last uodated' means
* Cannot create a custom download
* Lack of information about licences and terms of use
* Titles and summaries are not informative
* Lack of deatils about who to contact for further information and support
* Lack of clarity on where the data originates from 
* Improve trust/recognition of non-govt sources //NEED TO CLARIFY
5. Use selected data
* Mixed and variable formats
* Not mobile friendly
* Too many steps restricting access
* Different standards
* No API access
* Licensing restrictions
* Reliance on others for interpretation
* Character corruption
