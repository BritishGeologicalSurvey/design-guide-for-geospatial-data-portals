# Spatial data portals

Increase the discoverability and usefulness of spatial databy designing data portals that satisfy user needs. Data portals differ by the data they provide and the audiences they serve, so these recommendations are general and focus on designs to address the frustrations that users experience at different stages of their data discovery journey.

## Background
Everything happens somewhere. Location is a fundamental aspect of many data and being able to combine and integrate seemingly diverse datasets using the places they relate can provide powerfuk insights. Although more and more spatial data is being made available on the internet there is concern that users are confused about where to go for authoritative, trustworthy information and concerns about what a dataset means and how it can be used for a new purpose.       

In 2018 user researchers and designers across the <u>Geo6</u> came together to explore the needs and frustrations experienced by the users of data portals containing spatial data.

Throughout 2019 the Geo6 have worked on solutions to address the pain points identified in the <u>DD2 report</u>.

## Using guidance
The guidance as arranged in categories that make up a typical user journey from first finding a data portals through to applied use of a selected dataset. Below is the archetypical journey people might go through in their search for data. It doesnâ€™t mean that every user will go through the same stages, but they represent the steps the majority of people would have to complete in order to find, get access and make use of spatial data.
