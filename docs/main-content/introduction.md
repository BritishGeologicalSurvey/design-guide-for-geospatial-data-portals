# Introduction

Making spatial data portals more useful and usable. Data portals can differ by the data they provide and the audiences they serve, so these recommendations are general and focus more on the frustrations and pain points users experience throughout different stages of their data discovery journey.

## Background
Something really broad about the histpry of spatial data access (on the web?).

In 2018 user researchers and designers across the <u>Geo6</u> came together to explore the needs and frustrations experienced by the users of data portals containing spatial data.

Throughout 2019 the Geo6 have worked on solutions to address the pain points identified in the <u>DD2 report</u>.

## Using guidance
The guidance as arranged in categories that make up a typical user journey from first finding a data portals through to applied use of a selected dataset. Below is the archetypical journey people might go through in their search for data. It doesnâ€™t mean that every user will go through the same stages, but they represent the steps the majority of people would have to complete in order to find, get access and make use of spatial data.
