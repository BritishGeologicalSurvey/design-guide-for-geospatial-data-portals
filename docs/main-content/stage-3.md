#### Guidance
# Help users to: Make sense of search results

> Search results should allow users to sort, filter and refine results quickly in a format that they can understand.

## Pain points

- Poor or invalid descriptions
- Overwhelming amount of results / data returned
- Multiple results contain the same data
- Ranking by "best match" did not match user expectations
- Frequency of search term per record is a bad descriptor of rank
- Misinformation within data sets
- Off the shelf search / sort and filter algorithms are often inadequate
- Acronyms are difficult to interpret and understand

## Design patterns
### Overview

   -  a. Sort by
   -  b. Applied filters
   -  c. Spatial search / filtering
   -  d. Filter by ...
  
3. Result 
   -  a. title

   -  c. meta tags
   -  d. publisher
   -  e. licence type
   -  f. last update date

## Design principles and recommendations
### When to use this pattern

Use this pattern when users are expecting returned search queries to be formatted as a list of results with further options to sort / filter and refine results. Keeping this page scannable will save users from being overwhelmed with too much content.
