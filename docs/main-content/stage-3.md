#### Guidance
# Help users to: Make sense of search results

Search results should allow users to sort, filter and refine results quickly in a format that they can understand.

## Pain points

- Poor or invalid descriptions
- Overwhelming amount of results / data returned
- Multiple results contain the same data
- Ranking by "best match" did not match user expectations
- Frequency of search term per record is a bad descriptor of rank
- Misinformation within data sets
- Off the shelf search / sort and filter algorithms are often inadequate
- Acronyms are difficult to interpret and understand
