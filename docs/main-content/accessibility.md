# GC: Accessibility guidance document

> Accessibility should be considered from the outset to ensure that as many people as possible can use your services. 

Although accessibility aims to provide the best possible experience for users with disabilities, it also applies to anyone who's ability may be affected by their circumstances, for example:

+ location - they could be in a noisy cafe, sunny park or area with slow wifi
+ health - they may be tired, affected by injury or medical procedure
+ equipment - mobile device or an older browser

### Meeting government accessibility requirements
 
The UK government has set out accessibility standards to follow. If you fail to meet those standards, you could be breaking the law.

To meet government accessibility requirements, digital services must:

+ meet level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) as a minimum
+ work on the most commonly used assistive technologies - including screen magnifiers, screen readers and speech recognition tools
+ include people with disabilities in user research
+ have an accessibility statement that explains how accessible the service is - you need to publish this when the service moves into public beta

You can find out more about the regulations by reading the latest guidance.
