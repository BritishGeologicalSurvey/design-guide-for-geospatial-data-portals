# Example Pages

Within this section you will find example pages that are considered most common to geospatial data portals. The pages described within this section show one possible implementation using the guidance set out in the [Help users to...](/main-content/steps/help-users-intro) sections. 

It does not mean this is the only way to design and develop a geospatial data portal. The design of the portal should also be based not only on these principles and examples, but also on the user needs, type of data being served and brand guidelines of your organisation.

Below are some key data portal pages:

* [Homepage](/main-content/pages/homepage)
* [Search/Search results](main-content/pages/search-and-results)
* [Dataset details](/main-content/pages/dataset-details)

Other pages may form part of a geospatial data portal, for example: **Help, FAQ, Contact Us, Latest/Most popular dataset pages, Featured Data**. Although these pages are important, they are not considered an essential part of the guidance relating to geospatial portals, therefore a greater emphasis has been placed on those pages and components considered as essential.
