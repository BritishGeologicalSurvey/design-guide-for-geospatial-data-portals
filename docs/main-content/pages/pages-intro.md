# Example Pages

Here you can find some example pages that are common to spatial data portals. They show how the design principles discussed in the [Help users to...](#) sections can be addressed in a wireframe form. 

It does not mean this is the only way to design/develop a geospatial data portal. The design of the portal should also be based not only on these principles and examples, but also on the user needs, type of data being served and brand guidelines of your organization.

Below are some key data portal pages:

* [Homepage](/main-content/pages/homepage)
* [Search page]()
* [Search results - list view]()
* [Search results - map view](main-content/pages/map-viewer)
* [Dataset details](/main-content/pages/dataset-details)

Other pages that might be included in data portals are - **Help, FAQ, Contact Us, Latest/Most popular dataset pages, Featured Data**. These pages can be important as well, but they are not essential, so they are not discussed in this documentation.
