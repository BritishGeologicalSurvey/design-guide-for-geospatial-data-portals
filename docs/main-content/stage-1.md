#### Guidance
# Help users to: Check if portal is relevant

> At the FIND stages users are presented only with a brief description of the dataset. And it usually is displayed in a list with many other datasets. That's why this information should be brief, easy to scan and human readable. Having a relating image that is relevant to the dataset can also help users evaluate the dataset at a glance.



Dataset aggregation websites might provide only a short summary or just a thumbnail of the indexed dataset. So it is important that metadata is structured in such a way that the webpages can be crawled. Schema.org is the most common way to describe the contents of a page in its HTML so that it can be crawled and indexed by search engines. At the INSPIRE workshop, geospatial data publishers from across Europe had found this to have a positive impact on the number of their pages indexed.



Also, sitemaps are essential to allow search engines to find all pages.
