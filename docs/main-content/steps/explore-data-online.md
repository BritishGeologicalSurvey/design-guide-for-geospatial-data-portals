### Help users to
# Explore data online

> Many users emphasize the ability to visualize or preview the data before downloading it. For some it might be all they require - to get a specific value from a certain location, e.g. the flood risk in a specific location. If they can get that information from the portal directly, they don't need to download the data itself.

How important the data exploration online, depends on the data being provided and the type of users who are accessing this data. Thus, some user research might be necessary to better understand the need for online data exploration.

## What it looks like

There are multiple ways that the data can be explored online - tables, charts, maps.

Users previewing the data online might have one of these goals:
* Find a specific value for a location of interest
* Preview the data online to get a better understanding of its contents

If users require only a specific value, there is no need to display additional information. After a simple post code or location search they could be presented with a value for that location.

*Flood risk information on gov.uk*

</div>

If technology and resources allow a more detailed data preview can also help users evaluate the dataset and do an exploratory data analysis within the data portal.

## Why/when to use this 'pattern'

This pattern can be used when specific user needs can be addressed directly within the data portal - providing them the information they require without downloading the dataset.

But this depends on the user needs and data type. If users require to download the whole dataset, then giving the option to preview it online can help them make a more informed decision about the usefulness of the dataset.
