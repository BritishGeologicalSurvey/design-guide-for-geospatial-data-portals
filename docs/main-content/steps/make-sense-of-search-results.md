### Help users to
# Make sense of search results

> Search results should be clearly presented with sufficient sorting and filtering options to help users further refine and sort their search results. It is important that users are given enough information to understand and identify relevant high quality results quickly.

Users will always arrive at a 'search results' page after performing a search query using one of the available search input methods. See [search for data](main-content/steps/search-for-data).

## What it looks like

Search results should clearly answer:

+ Which results are relevant to the search query?
+ Are results ranked in order of data quality?
+ How might users refine (sort and filter), search results?
+ Where do users go to find out information about a single record?

### 1. Overview / layout for the presentation of results

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Wireframe**
<a href="/dd3-wireframes/_media/overview/3.results.png" target="_blank"><img src="/dd3-wireframes/_media/overview/3.results.png" data-no-zoom/></a>
<!-- tabs:end -->

### 2. Number of results

<a href="/dd3-wireframes/_media/stage-3-results/2-number_of_results.png" target="_blank"><img src="/dd3-wireframes/_media/stage-3-results/2-number_of_results.png" data-no-zoom/></a>

Information about the returned search should be presented to the user to help them identify when to change, refine or continue with their search query.

### 3. Faceted search (by parent / child categories)

<a href="/dd3-wireframes/_media/stage-3-results/3-faceted_search.png" target="_blank"><img src="/dd3-wireframes/_media/stage-3-results/3-faceted_search.png" data-no-zoom/></a>

Faceted search allows users to refine search results through sorting (order of results), filtering (number of results) and categorisation (parent category). Sorting and filtering should be available to users at the time of entering keywords and not buried behind an advanced search option. In addition, Sorting and filtering are perceived as the same function and should therefore appear in the same part of the user interface.

### 4. Remove filters

<a href="/dd3-wireframes/_media/stage-3-results/4-clear_filters.png" target="_blank"><img src="/dd3-wireframes/_media/stage-3-results/4-clear_filters.png" data-no-zoom/></a>

Users should be able to undo a selection quickly and easily 

### 5. Sort by

<a href="/dd3-wireframes/_media/stage-3-results/5-sort_by.png" target="_blank"><img src="/dd3-wireframes/_media/stage-3-results/5-sort_by.png" data-no-zoom/></a>

Clear and precise sorting information should be made available to the user to arrange results to their preference.

### 6. Apply filters
<a href="/dd3-wireframes/_media/stage-3-results/6-apply_filters.png" target="_blank"><img src="/dd3-wireframes/_media/stage-3-results/6-apply_filters.png" data-no-zoom/></a>

Users should be able to quickly and easily apply filters remove results that are not of relevance to their search query.

### 7. Presentation of results
#### a. Ranked ordering by keyword relevance / data quality
<a href="/dd3-wireframes/_media/stage-3-results/7a-presentation_of_results.png" target="_blank"><img src="/dd3-wireframes/_media/stage-3-results/7a-presentation_of_results.png" data-no-zoom/></a>

Each record should show a title, description, publisher information and publication / update dates, key meta data, licence type and an option to feedback on the result

#### b. Spatial ordering by area
<a href="/dd3-wireframes/_media/stage-3-results/7b-presentation_of_results.png" target="_blank"><img src="/dd3-wireframes/_media/stage-3-results/7b-presentation_of_results.png" data-no-zoom/></a>

Spatial presentation of results by preference of area should be made available for the user to refine their search to a specific location / spatial region.


<!-- ### 8. Pagination - TO ADD -->

## Why/when to use this 'pattern'

When a user is searching for data to answer a specific research question.

<summary>Essential components</summary>
<br>
Below is a checklist of components/information that are relevant for this task.

These components can be arranged in many ways, but the ones with highest relevance should be the most visible/accessible.

?> 1 - high relevance, 2 - medium relevance, 3 - low relevance

<!-- Table of component start -->

| Component             | Description                                                                                                     |  Relevance |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------:|
| ...                   | ...                                                                                                             |     1      |
