<!-- Table of component start -->

| Component             | Description                                                                                                     |  Relevance |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------:|
| Title                 | This will be the first thing that users see in search results, so it has to clear and descriptive. Title could also include the organisation who generated the dataset.                                                                                  |     1      |
| Description / Summary | Short description should be no longer than a few paragraphs, since users are likely to see only the first one or two sentences of this summary in the search results.   |     1      |
