### Help users to
# Make sense of search results

> Search results should be clearly presented with sufficient sorting and filtering options to help users further refine and sort their search results. It is important that users are given enough information to understand and identify relevant high quality results quickly.

Faceted search allow users to refine search results through sorting (order of results), filtering (number of results) and categorisation (parent category). Sorting and filtering should be available to users at the time of entering keywords and not hidden or buried behind an "advanced search option". In addition, sorting and filtering are perceived as the same function and should therefore appear in the same part of the user interface.

Users will always arrive at a 'search results' page after performing a search query using one of the available search input methods. See [search for 
data](main-content/steps/search-for-data).

## What it looks like

!> Userâ€™s perception of dataset quality is driven by a number of different factors, such as publisher, publication date, frequency of updates, well-described metadata, complete dataset, clearly presented within the portal. More information on the help you can give to your users can be found on the [assess data quality](../../main-content/steps/assess-data-quality) page.

Search results should clearly answer:

+ Understand which results are relevant to the search query
+ Assess the likely data quality of each dataset presented
+ Refine, sort and filter search results to identify the most relevant datasets
+ Easily access more information about a single record


### 1. Number of results

<div class="image-container">
<a href="/dd3-wireframes/_media/stage-3-results/2-number_of_results.png" target="_blank"><img src="/dd3-wireframes/_media/stage-3-results/2-number_of_results.png" style="max-width: 452px;"/></a>

*Information about the returned search should be presented to the user to help them identify when to change, refine or continue with their search query*

</div>

### 2. Faceted search (by parent / child categories)

<div class="image-container">

<a href="/dd3-wireframes/_media/stage-3-results/3-faceted_search.png" target="_blank"><img src="/dd3-wireframes/_media/stage-3-results/3-faceted_search.png" data-no-zoom/></a>

*Search field available for further refinement or for starting a new query*

</div>

### 3. Remove filters

<div class="image-container">
<a href="/dd3-wireframes/_media/stage-3-results/4-clear_filters.png" target="_blank"><img src="/dd3-wireframes/_media/stage-3-results/4-clear_filters.png" style="max-width: 300px;"/></a>

*Users should be able to undo a selection quickly and easily*
</div>

### 4. Sort by

<div class="image-container">
<a href="/dd3-wireframes/_media/stage-3-results/5-sort_by.png" target="_blank"><img src="/dd3-wireframes/_media/stage-3-results/5-sort_by.png" style="max-width: 232px;" data-no-zoom/></a>

*Clear and precise sorting information should be made available to the user to arrange results to their preference*

</div>

### 5. Apply filters

<div class="image-container">
<a href="/dd3-wireframes/_media/stage-3-results/6-apply_filters.png" target="_blank"><img src="/dd3-wireframes/_media/stage-3-results/6-apply_filters.png" style="max-width: 304px;"/></a>

*Users should be able to quickly and easily apply filters remove results that are not of relevance to their search query*

</div>

### 6. Geospatial filter

<div class="image-container">
<a href="/dd3-wireframes/_media/stage-3-results/7b-presentation_of_results.png" target="_blank"><img src="/dd3-wireframes/_media/stage-3-results/7b-presentation_of_results.png" style="max-width: 299px;"/></a>

*Geospatial presentation of results by preference of area should be made available for the user to refine their search to a specific location / spatial region*

</div>

### 7. Results list


<div class="image-container">
<a href="/dd3-wireframes/_media/stage-3-results/7a-presentation_of_results.png" target="_blank"><img src="/dd3-wireframes/_media/stage-3-results/7a-presentation_of_results.png" data-no-zoom/></a>

*Each record should show a title, description, publisher information and publication / update dates, key meta data, licence type and an option to feedback on the result*

</div>
