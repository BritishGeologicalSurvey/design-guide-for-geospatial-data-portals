# Make sense of search results

> Search results should be clearly presented with sufficient sorting and filtering options to help users further refine and sort their search results. It is important that users are given enough information to understand and identify relevant high quality results quickly.

Users will always arrive at a 'search results' page after performing a search query using one of the available search input methods. See [search for data](main-content/steps/search-for-data).

## What it looks like

Search results should clearly answer:

+ Which results are relevant to the search query?
+ Are results ranked in order of data quality?
+ How might users refine (sort and filter), search results?
+ Where do users go to find out information about a single record?

### 1. Overview / layout for the presentation of results

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Wireframe**
<a href="/dd3-wireframes/_media/overview/3.results.png" target="_blank"><img src="/dd3-wireframes/_media/overview/3.results.png" data-no-zoom/></a>
<!-- tabs:end -->

### 2. Number of results

### 3. Faceted search (by parent / child categories)

### 4. Remove filters

### 5. Sort by

### 6. Apply filters

### 7. Presentation of results

#### a. Ranked ordering by keyword relevance / data quality

#### b. Spatial ordering by area

### 8. Individual record / listing

#### a. Title / description / publisher
#### b. Key meta information
#### c. Licence type
#### d. Feedback for crowdsourcing data quality and relevancy

### 9. Pagination

## Why/when to use this 'pattern'

When a user is searching for data to answer a specific research question.
