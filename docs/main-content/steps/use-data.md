### Help users to
# Use data

> Help users download data in a format they prefer. The process for downloading data should be simple and straight-forward. If possible users should be able to select which files from the dataset they want to download. If it is not possible, it should be made clear what is included in the download file and how big the file size is.

Regardless of whether the dataset is freely available or requires payment, users prefer being able to preview the data online and to know any other requirements for using the dataset upfront.

The dataset would be usually downloaded from the [dataset details page](/main-content/pages/dataset-details).

## What it looks like

### 1. Preview data online

Using the dataset can start directly in the portal. Read more about it in the ['Explore data online'](/main-content/steps/explore-data-online) section. 

### 2. Straightforward process for downloading data

People don't like when there are too many steps restricting access to datasets [(Data Discoverability project, 2020](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/finding-geospatial-data/finding-geospatial-data)). Data downloading process should be as simple as possible. If any additional steps are required in order to access the datasets, they should be made clear upfront with easily findable instructions on how to perform them.

### 3. Download button

Download links for datasets should be clearly visible and identifiable. If dataset is not available for download yet, it should be indicated why and if/when the dataset will become available.

Using icons can also help users recognise download links. If icons are used in the data portal, they should be simple and always include a text label alongside the icon.

### 4. Clear licencing information

If any licencing restrictions apply, they should be made clear upfront with links to further information where appropriate.

### 5. Display data formats

Users should know what format the data is in before downloading it, ideally with access to definitions of those file types. Users are usually looking for data that can work with the tools they use.

### 6. Dynamic data access

Sometimes users prefer to access data in a more flexible way, e.g application programming interface (API) access. If data can be accessed through other methods, clear instructions on how to do that should be easily accessible.

### 7. File selection for partial downloads

If possible, allow users to select which files in the dataset they want to download. If it's not possible, they should at least know what is included in the download file.

### 8. Sharing options

User might want to share links with colleagues or send a link to themselves for later use.
