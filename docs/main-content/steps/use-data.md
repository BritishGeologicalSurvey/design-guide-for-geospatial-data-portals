### Help users to
# Use data

> Help users download data in a format they prefer. The process for downloading data should be simple and straight-forward. If possible users should be able to select which files from the dataset they want to download. If not, it should be made clear what is included in the download file and how big the file size is.

Regardless of whether the dataset is freely available or requires payment, users prefer being able to preview the data online and to know any other requirements for using the dataset upfront.

The dataset would be usually downlaoded from the [dataset details page](/main-content/pages/dataset-details).

## What it looks like

### 1. Download button

Download link should be clearly visible on the dataset details page. If dataset is not available for download yet, it should be  indicated why and if/when the dataset will become available.

### 2. Clear licencing information

If any licencing restrictions apply, they should be made clear upfront.

### 3. Display data formats

Users should know what format the data is in before downloading it.

</div>

### 4. API Access

If data can be accessed through an API, clear instructions how to do that should be easily accessible to users.

### 5. File selection for partial downloads

If possible, allow users to select which files in the dataset to download. If not, they should at least know what is included in the download file

<div class="image-container">

</div>

### 6. Sharing options
