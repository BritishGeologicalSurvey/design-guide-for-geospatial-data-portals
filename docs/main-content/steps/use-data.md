### Help users to
# Use data

> Help users download data in a format they prefer. The process for downloading data should be simple and straight-forward. If possible users should be able to select which files from the dataset they want to download. If not, it should be made clear what is included in the download file and how big the file size is.

## What it looks like

<div class="image-container">

![Google results](../../_media/use-data/download-panel.png)

*Download panel on dataset details page*

</div>

### 1. Easy to find download button

Download link should be clearly visible on the dataset details page. If dataset is not available for download yet, it should be clearly indicated why and if/when the dataset will become available.

### 2. Clear licencing restrictions

If any licencing restrictions apply, they should be made clear upfront.

### 3. Display data format(s)

Users should know what format the data is in before downloading it.

<div class="image-container">

*Data formats*

</div>

### 4. API Access

If data can be accessed through an API, clear instructions how to do that should be easily accessible to users.

### 5. Allow users to select files for download

If possible, allow users to select which files in the dataset to download. If not, they should at least know what is included in the download file

### 6. Provide shareable links

User might want to share links with colleagues or send a link to themselves for later use.

*Download panel on dataset details page*

</div>

## Why/when to use this 'pattern'

Download links to datasets should be accessible from dataset details page.
