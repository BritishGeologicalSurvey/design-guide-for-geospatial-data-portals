### Help users to
# Use data

> Help users to download data in the format they prefer. Ensure this download process is simple and straight-forward. Where possible, allow for the partial download of datasets. Ensure the contents of the dataset are made clear, the size of the download and what formats are included.

Whether a dataset is freely available or requires payment, users prefer having the option to preview data prior to download, with information describing what is required to use the dataset. For more information read how to help users to... [explore data online](main-content/steps/explore-data-online).

Ensure datasets are downloadable from their [dataset details page](/main-content/pages/dataset-details).

## What it looks like

### 1. Preview data online

Ensure datasets can be assessed directly in the portal. Read more about it in the ['Explore data online'](/main-content/steps/explore-data-online) section. 

### 2. Straightforward process for downloading data

Restricting access to datasets can often lead to user frustration [(Data Discoverability project, 2020](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/finding-geospatial-data/finding-geospatial-data)). Ensure the data download process is as simple as possible. If there are additional steps required to access data, they should be made accessible to the user, with clear instructions.

### 3. Download button

Download buttons and links for datasets should be clearly visible and identifiable. Any datasets that are not available for download (e.g. undergoing review for publication), should be described as such with information about when the dataset will become available.

The use of icons will help users recognise download links. If icons are used, they should be simple and always include a text label.

### 4. Clear licencing information

If any licencing restrictions apply, they should be made clear upfront with links to further information where appropriate.

### 5. Display data formats

Ensure users know what format the data is in before download, ideally with access to definitions of those file types. Users are usually looking for data that can work with the tools they use.

<div class="image-container">

</div>

### 6. Dynamic data access

Users sometimes prefer to access data in a flexible way, e.g. application programming interface (API) access. If data can be accessed through other methods, clear instructions on how to do that should be provided.

### 7. File selection for partial downloads

Where possible, allow users to select files from a dataset for a partial download. Datasets should be described with information about what is included.

<div class="image-container">

![Google results](../../_media/use-data/data-preview.png)

*Option to select and preview the files included in the dataset*

</div>

### 8. Sharing options

A user might want to share links with colleagues or send a link to themselves for later use.
