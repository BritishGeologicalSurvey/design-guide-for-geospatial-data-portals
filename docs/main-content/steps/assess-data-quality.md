# Assess data quality 

> Data quality may not always be in the hands of data portal's maintainers. To ensure that users can make and informed decision about the dataset, they should know who produced the dataset and when it was updated last.

## What it looks like

Knowing the organization that created the dataset and when it was updated last is important both on the Search Results and Dataset Details page.

User trusts datasets more from the organizations they are familiar with. And knowing that the dataset has been updated recently can give them the confidence the dataset is being maintained.
