### Help users to
# Assess data quality 

> Data quality may not always be in the hands of data portal's maintainers. To ensure that users can make and informed decision about the dataset, they should know who produced the dataset and when it was updated last.

 If the dataset gets regular updates, it might also be important to know how frequent those updates are.

## What it looks like

Knowing the organization that created the dataset and when it was updated last is important both on the Search Results and Dataset Details page.

User trusts datasets more from the organizations they are familiar with. And knowing that the dataset has been updated recently can give them the confidence the dataset is being maintained.

## Why/when to use this 'pattern'

Knowing the properties of the dataset that convey its quality are important both at the searching stage and exploring a specific dataset.
