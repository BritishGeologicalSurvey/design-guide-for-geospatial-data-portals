### Help users to
# Assess dataset quality 

> Data quality may not always be in the hands of data portal's maintainers. To ensure that users can make and informed decision about the dataset, they should know who produced the dataset and when it was updated last.

 If the dataset gets regular updates, it might also be important to know how frequent those updates are.

## What it looks like

Knowing the organization that created the dataset and when it was updated last is important both on the Search Results and Dataset Details page.

### 1. Dataset creator

Organization that produced the dataset should be clearly visible. It should be easy to find this information both on the [search results](#) page and the dataset [details pages](main-content/pages/dataset-details).

User trusts datasets more from the organizations they are familiar with.

If a logo is available it should be displayed as well for easier recognition.

*Dataset details heading. Dataset details page should make this information available at a glance as well*

</div>

### 2. Last updated

 Knowing that the dataset has been updated recently can give them the confidence the dataset is being maintained. If the dataset is being updated frequently, that frequency should be made know to users as well.

*The frequency of updates can be displayed on the dataset details page*

## When to use

Knowing the properties of the dataset that convey its quality are important both at the searching stage and exploring a specific dataset.
