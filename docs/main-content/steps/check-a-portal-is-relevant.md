### Help users to
# Check if portal is relevant

> Clearly communicate what subject matters, geographical areas and data licensing users can expect to find within the portal. Doing this helps users save time as it tells them upfront whether a new portal is going to help them find the data they need.

Users might not always arrive via a data portal homepage, so this essential information should always be just a few clicks away.

## What it looks like

The homepage should clearly answer these key questions:

## 1. Purpose of data portal

What is the purpose of this data portal, what are the topics it covers?

<div class="image-container">

![Home heading](../../_media/check-portal-is-relevant/portal-purpose.png)

*Heading for the homepage*

</div>

## 2. Organization managing this portal

Users should be able to easily find more details about the organization managing the data portal either from the About Us page or the organization logo in the navbar.

<div class="image-container">

![navbar](../../_media/check-portal-is-relevant/navbar.png)

*Navigation bar with organization's logo and link to About Us page*

</div>

## 3. Licencing

Ideally users should be able to find the licencing details on the homepage ([see #1](/main-content/steps/check-a-portal-is-relevant#1-what-is-the-purpose-of-this-data-portal-what-are-the-topics-it-covers))

If datasets have different licences,the information should be provided on each dataset's details page.

## 4. Where to start?

Where do users start searching/exploring the data? If the data portal does not not allow users to search for data directly from the homepage, they should easily find instructions where to start.

## When to use

These concepts are useful when introducing new users to the data portal. It can also be handy for returning users who want to explore datasets by topic or check the licencing information for dataset(s) they used.

## Example page

> **[Homepage](/main-content/pages/homepage)**
