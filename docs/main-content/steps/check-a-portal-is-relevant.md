<div class="small-heading" style="margin-top: 45px; font-size: 32px;">Help users to...</div>
<h1 id="check-a-portal-is-relevant" style="margin-top: 0px">Check if a portal is relevant</h1>

> Clearly communicate which subject matters, geographical areas and data licencing users can expect to find, helping users save time by confirming upfront whether your portal is relevant to their data needs.

Ensure this information is just a few clicks away as users might not always arrive via a data portal homepage.

## What it looks like

The homepage should clearly present the following information:

### 1. Purpose of data portal

The purpose of your data portal and the topics covered.

<div class="image-container">

![Homepage heading for geospatial data portal](../../_media/check-portal-is-relevant/portal-purpose.png)

*Homepage heading*

</div>

### 2. Organisation managing this portal

Users should be able to easily find more information about the organisation managing the data portal. Include an 'About Us' page and an organisation logo in the navigation bar.

<div class="image-container">

![Navigation bar for geospatial data portal](../../_media/check-portal-is-relevant/navbar.png)

*Navigation bar with organisation's logo and a link to the 'About Us' page*

</div>

### 3. Licencing

Ensure users have access to clear licencing information on the homepage ([see #1](/main-content/steps/check-a-portal-is-relevant#1-what-is-the-purpose-of-this-data-portal-what-are-the-topics-it-covers))

If datasets have different licences, this information should be presented with each dataset in search results and their details page.

### 4. Where to start?

Ensure users are provided with instructions on where to start searching or exploring data if this is not included on the home page.
