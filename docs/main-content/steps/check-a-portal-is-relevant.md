### Help users to
# Check if portal is relevant

> Clearly communicate what subject matters, geographical areas and data licensing users can expect to find within the portal. Doing this helps users save time as it tells them upfront whether a new portal is going to help them find the data they need.

Users might not always arrive to data portals homepage, so this essential information should always be a few clicks away.

## What it looks like

The homepage should clearly answer these key questions:
* What is the purpose of this data portal, what are the topics it covers?
* Who is the organization managing this portal?
* What licence is the data shared under?
* Where do users start searching/exploring the data?

If users arrive at other pages, and not the homepage, they should be able to easily access the Home or the About Us pages.

## Why/when to use this 'pattern'

This pattern/page is useful when introducing new users to the data portal. It can also be handy for returning users who want to explore datasets by topic or check the licencing information for dataset(s) they used.
