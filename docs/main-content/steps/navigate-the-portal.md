### Help users to
# Navigate the portal

> Inform users with glanceable information about where they are in the data portal navigation. Ensure navigation is made easy with a quick way to jump to related content or back to the homepage.

It is possible that the homepage may not be the entry point for users into your data portal. This is true of users who discover a specific dataset or search facility via direct links (e.g. from search engine results). Therefore, ensure users can easily make sense of where they are, and how they can explore additional content.

## What it looks like

### 1. Consistent navigation across the website

Navigation should be consistent, enabling users to understand where in the website they are and how to find relevant information. Titles should always be in the same place, links should have the same style and breadcrumbs should have consistent structure. 

### 2. Page title

Page titles allow users to understand the purpose of each page and ensure relevant pages appear higher in search engine rankings. Titles displayed in the browser window give users a useful reference to easily find when switching between tabs in their web browser.

*Pages should have clear, easy to find titles*

</div>

### 3. Fixed position of the main navigation bar

A navigation bar should include the portal name, logo and the most important links.

*The navigation bar allows users to navigate back to the homepage and other top level pages*

</div>

### 4. Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs ensure users can easily navigate to parent pages within the website's navigation hierarchy.

*Human readable breadcrumbs*

</div>

### 5. Links back to the homepage

Ensure users have a quick and consistent way to easily navigate back to the homepage.

### 6. Related datasets

Showing related datasets on the [dataset details pages](/main-content/pages/dataset-details) can help users explore other datasets in the same region or from the same topic. Ensure any recommendations shown are specific and relevant to what a user is searching for.

Ensure large lists of *related datasets* are easy to read by splitting them into groups according to topic, location or another relevant attribute.
