### Help users to
# Navigate the portal

> Users should always know where they are and have an easy way to jump to related content or back to data portal's homepage.

Homepage will not be the entry point to a data portal to most of the users. Thus it important that they can easily make sense of where they are and how they can explore additional content.

## What it looks like

This are some of the questions that should be answered when thinking about the overall navigation and navigation within a specific page:
* Does a page have a clear title?
* Does it have human readable breadcrumbs?
* Is there an easy way to get back to homepage?
* If it's a dataset details page - is it possible to jump to the topic that this dataset belongs to?
