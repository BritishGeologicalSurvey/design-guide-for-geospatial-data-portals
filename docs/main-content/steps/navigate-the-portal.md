### Help users to
# Navigate the portal

> Users should always know where they are and have an easy way to jump to related content or back to the data portal homepage.

Homepage may not be the entry point to a data portal for many users, especially those who discover a specific dataset or search facility through direct links provided by search engine results. Thus it is important that they can easily make sense of where they are and how they can explore additional content.

## What it looks like

## 1. Page title

The title should describe the contents of the page

<div class="image-container">

![Google results](../../_media/help-navigate/simple-title.png)

*Pages should have clear, easy to find titles*

</div>

## 2. Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs allow users to easily jump to parent pages and see the website structure

<div class="image-container">

![Google results](../../_media/help-navigate/breadcrumbs.png)

*Human readable breadcrumbs*

</div>

## 3. Fixed main navigation bar

In case people get lost in the website structure, they should always be able to get back to homepage easily.

<div class="image-container">

![navbar](../../_media/check-portal-is-relevant/navbar.png)

*Navbar allows users to navigate back to homepage and other top level pages*

</div>

## 4. Related datasets

Can users easily find related datasets or datasets that belong to the same topic?

<div class="image-container">

![related datasets](../../_media/help-navigate/related-datasets.png)

*Easy way to explore related content*

</div>

## 5. Navigate home

Help users easily navigate to homepage. If users arrive at other pages, and not the homepage, they should be able to easily access the Home or the About Us pages.


## 6. Consistent navigation

* The titles should always be in the same place.
* Links should have the same style
* Breadcrumbs should have consistent structure.


## When to use

To be used on every page throughout the data portal and to highlight which page the user is currently on.
