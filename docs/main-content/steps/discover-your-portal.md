### Help users to
# Discover your portal

> Maximise the discoverability of data portals through search engine optimisation. This matters because most people looking for spatial data begin their journey in search engines. The first contact with a new data portal will likely be through the search engine results.

How the data portal will be presented in the search results depends on the search engine optimisation used by the portal developers. 

To ensure that data portals and the datasets they contain are presented well in search engines it is important to ensure they have the correct and machine readable meta-data. 
A more detailed report and recommendations can be found in the report below.

## What it looks like

### 1. Title

The heading should briefly describe the dataset. If any extra text is used - organization name, date, etc. - it should be placed at the end of dataset name, e.g. **dataset-title | organization name | date-produced**.

### 2. Description

Only the first few lines of the description will be visible in the search results, so the first few sentences should have the most relevant information.

| Title                 | This will be the first thing that users see in search results, so it has to clear and descriptive. Title could also include the organisation who generated the dataset.                                                                                  |     1      |
| Description / Summary | Short description should be no longer than a few paragraphs, since users are likely to see only the first one or two sentences of this summary in the search results.   |     1      |
