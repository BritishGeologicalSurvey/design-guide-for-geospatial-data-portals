> Maximise the discoverability of data portals through search engine optimisation. Most users begin their journey in a search engine, making discoverability an important part of the user experience. A user's first contact will likely be through a search engine's results page.

How a data portal is presented in search results depends on the search engine optimisation (SEO), undertaken as part of the design and development process.

Data portals and their datasets are well presented by ensuring that correct and machine readable metadata is made available to search engines as part of their crawling process. Recommendations on how to achieve this can be found in the following report:

## What it looks like

While using a search engine, users are most likely to discover either a dataset record hosted by the data portal or the homepage of the portal. Help users by ensuring that datasets have easy to read and understandable titles and descriptions, the portal itself should have a memorable URL and a brief description of its purpose. 

### 1. Dataset title

The heading should briefly describe the dataset. If any extra text is used - organisation name, date, etc. - it should be placed at the end of dataset name, e.g. **dataset-title | organisation name | date-produced**.

### 2. Dataset description

Only the first few lines of the description will be visible in the search results, so the first few sentences should have the most relevant information.

### 3. Portal URL

The URL should be short, relevant and memorable.

### 4. Portal name

Ensure the data portal URL and name are the same, or at the least, human readable and memorable.

### 5. Portal description

The data portal should have a brief description of its purpose and the type of data served.
