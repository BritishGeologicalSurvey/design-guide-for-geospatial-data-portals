# HTTP and Headers

(INTRO / PURPOSE HERE : TODO )

## Readonly Methods

### GET
Get or search for data using only the URL to express parameters. Should exactly match JSON `query` object parameters for a POST request. Since it is not viable for a GET request to include JSON the parameters should be provided as a query string.

Notes and guidelines:
* Can be used via the browsers address bar (address bar friendly)
* Easy for users of all types to modify
* Easily sharable amongst non-technical stakeholders and social media

### POST (GET by POST)
Get or search for data using the request body to express parameters. Should exactly match query parameters for a GET request (except for the complex ones). `query=true` must be added as the only query parameter to ensure the POST can be distinguished from a standard resource creation POST.

Notes and guidelines:
* Safely supports large request parameters
* Easily allows for hierarchical and complex parameters
* __No__ query string parameters, except `query=true`, should be placed in the URL and any found there should be ignored. Having to parse parameters from multiple locations raises awkward questions about priority, requires more implementation, makes it easier to introduce bugs and presents the user with unnecessary choices

### HEAD (Optional)
Same as a GET request except only the headers are returned. Avoids transferring, and in some cases processing, large datasets when only the header information is required by the user. Often used to check if an endpoint is alive so its best to set no caching in return headers.

## Writable Methods
For resource modification the following methods are available:

Method | Description
:---: | :---
POST | Used to create a new resource item. The `query` query parameter is used to distinguish between __GET by POST__ and **Create by POST** requests. It can be omitted but if set must not have the value `true`
PUT | Used to update a resource item
DELETE | Used to delete a resource item

## HTTP Headers
Useful request and response headers are usually provided automatically by most development frameworks and software systems. Here are a few important ones and a few that may need to be added manually such as those that control caching:

### Request headers
Key | Description | Example
:--- | :--- | :---
Accept | Content-Types that are acceptable for the response | `Accept: application/json`
Authorization | Authentication credentials for HTTP authentication | `Authorization: Basic abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456`
Cache-Control | Used to specify directives that must be obeyed by all caching mechanisms along the request-response chain | `Cache-Control: no-cache`
If-None-Match | Allows a 304 Not Modified to be returned if content is unchanged | `If-None-Match: "737060cd8c284d8af7ad3082f209582d"`

### Response headers
Key | Description | Example
:--- | :--- | :---
Content-Type | The MIME type of this content | `Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8`
Access-Control-Allow-Origin | Specifying which web sites can participate in cross-origin resource sharing | `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://www.example.com`
Access-Control-Allow-Methods | Specifying which HTTP methods can participate in cross-origin resource sharing | `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST`
Access-Control-Allow-Headers | Specifying which HTTP headers can participate in cross-origin resource sharing (some headers are always allowed) | `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Cache-Control`
Cache-Control | Tells all caching mechanisms from server to client whether they may cache this object. It is measured in seconds | `Cache-Control: max-age=3600`
Content-Length | The length of the response body in octets (8-bit bytes) | `Content-Length: 348`
Content-Disposition | An opportunity to raise a "File Download" dialogue box for a known MIME type with binary format or suggest a filename for dynamic content | `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="fname.ext"`
Date | The date and time that the message was sent (format: [RFC7231][rfc7231]) | `Date: Tue, 15 Nov 1994 08:12:31 GMT`
Last-Modified | The last modified date for the requested object (format: [RFC7231][rfc7231]) | `Last-Modified: Tue, 15 Nov 1994 12:45:26 GMT`

## Response Codes
Most HTTP response codes are for fairly specific use cases and our web APIs are unlikely to require most. The number of HTTP response codes should be limited in order to avoid causing the consumer to handle lots of different eventualities. They will just implement a catch all in any case but its useful during development to have a few different ones. Only the following codes should be used unless there is good reason to use extra:

__Warning:__ The 'reason phrases' or short descriptions defined in the official HTTP specification can be highly misleading. Make sure to double check the meaning with our friend Google.

Code | Reason phrase | Description
:---: | :--- | :---
__200__ | OK | Successfully carried out the request
201 | Created | Successfully carried out the creation of a new resource
\*304 | Not Modified | Often handled by development frameworks but responses may need to be checked and code specifically by the developer
**400** | Bad Request | General request failure and its the clients fault
\*401 | Unauthorised | Called 'unauthorised' but officially defined as 'unauthenticated'. The user has not provided authentication credentials or the ones provided are not valid
\*403 | Forbidden | The server has __authenticated__ the client (knows who they are) but they are not **authorised** (donâ€™t have permission) to access the requested resource
\*404 | Not Found | The requested resource could not be found. Should not be confused with not having any results to return; if there are no results matching the search criteria then a 200 response code should be returned but with no results. This code can also be used to hide endpoints that only authorised users should know exists
415 | Unsupported Media Type | The request entity has a media type which the server or resource does not support. E.g. they sent the request body as XML and not JSON
__500__ | Internal Server Error | General request failure and its the servers fault
501 | Not Implemented | The server either does not recognize the request method, or it lacks the ability to fulfill the request. Usually this implies future availability e.g. it has been defined in the public specification for the service but has not yet been implemented

\* Hopefully the API management systems and choice of frameworks remove the need to use these response codes in the actual web API.
