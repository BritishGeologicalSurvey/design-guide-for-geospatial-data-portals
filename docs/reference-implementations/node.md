## BGS Index and Meta data API template

(LINK to GIT REPOSITRY)

For simple APIs serving BGS data where:
* Data is in a DB Query Layer (with maybe a couple of dictionaries)
* The Query Layer is an index of maps/reports/rocks/fossils/...
* Each item has relatively few simple properties
* Each item optionally has a link to an external resource (e.g. large image viewer or PDF download)
* API provides only "search", "full details" and "dictionary (dropdown)" endpoints
